RISC-V is an open standard instruction set architecture (ISA) that has gained significant traction in the tech industry due to its flexibility and extensibility. Unlike proprietary ISAs, RISC-V is free and open, allowing anyone to design, manufacture, and sell RISC-V chips and software without licensing fees. This openness promotes innovation and customization, making it ideal for a wide range of applications, from academic research to commercial products. Its modular design supports a simplified core while allowing for specialized extensions, making RISC-V a versatile choice for modern computing needs.

Hello RISC-V code snippets:

{% highlight c %}
int main(void)
{
printf("Hello RISC-V")
}
#=> prints 'Hello RISC-V' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
